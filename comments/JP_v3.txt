1) The note should aim for a more general audience (such as new graduate students).
Keeping this in mind, you should give clear explanations/reasons for
the choices of instrumentation and methods. For example, in the abstract, you should
mention the typical Hall A running condition for beam current (a few microA to 100 A)
as a reference scale to be compared to what g2p try to deal with (50-100 nA). Also later
when you talking about uncertainties, you keep mention each one contributed to certain
micro C. But never give a reference value (page 11, 0.86 uC, how big is it, relative to what?)

2) Last sentence in the abstract, tungsten calorimeter is used to calibrate BCM while
receiver/DAQ are part of BCM readout system, they are not parallel. Maybe you can put
new receiver/DAQ into preceding sentence:
 "A new BCM receiver and DAQ system were used to measure beam current at such a low
current range. A tungsten calorimeter was used to calibrate the BCMs. This technical note
summarizes the calibration procedure and the performance of the BCMs."

3) Section 1, first paragraph and Fig. 1. The figure should put emphasize on BCMs and tungsten
calorimeter. Should have BCM(u), BCM (d) and the Unser on the figure to make your text easier
to understand.

4)Section 1.1, 3rd line "current environment a range of"
--> "current range of"
Modified

5) Section 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3,
   a) not clear why the counts need to subtract ped
   rewrite the sentence in section 2 for the the introduction of pedestal
   b) seems eq (5) and (6) are inconsistent, should eq (5) to have the closing perenthis be after 103700/s?
   c) not clear why eq (5) (or (7)) needs to have 971.65 us/1041.65us (875us/1041.65us)?
   As mentioned in section 2.2, 

6) fig 11, why top right figure different from top left figure?
Temerature at top left approachs close to 30 while top right approaches 26?
Sorry they are the different period figures. I modified the plot in top left.

7) Section 2.4 for uncertainty, it is important to have the number reference to something.
Looking at Fig 11, top two left plot, the temerature variation is ~ 0.3
while the total temperature rise is ~ 9. This seems give an uncretainty of more than 3%?
Looking at fig. 14, looking at 7 points on top right, the fluctuation is +- 0.3 compared to
3.6, shold be 10%, not 0.8 %?
Added value reference of 30uC charge received in tungsten. 
Fig11. As mentioned in section 2, we only use the measured temperature value while the temperature became stable. When the beam just off, the temperature in the tungsten is not uniform, the value in RTD will continuing changing, that's why you saw the fluctuating  when the beam just stop. Also we only take care about the relative temperature rise for 6 RTDs.
Fig14. The 0.8% fluctuating is only for the points right of the red line, the calibration constant changed in April. 19.  Also I use the RMS, not the maximum fluctuation. Should I need to use the maximum fluctuation instead? Added some descriptions in the title.
