add an introduction of why we want to measure the charge.
Added "The measured charge was further used to get the accurate physics asymmetries" in abstract 

line 5 don't use "'s" in written english

12-13 Unser was not used  because it has am accuracy of 0.5 uA so it
is not usable at low current. Faraday cup has about same accuracy and
loss in the machine needs to be taken into account.

Put a paragraph describing the helicity structure and delayed helicity
and after explain what is the ring buffer

Can you add a conclusion for the stability of the calibration with time ?

Do we have two calibrations with exact same settings ?

May run through the spell checker I think there might be a few more
typos I missed.
